# Carbon
Carbon programming language

# Introduction
Carbon is an interpreted, object oriented, VM-based, statically typed scripting language. It is intended to be simple, easy to use and easy to embed while maintaining flexibility. It is currently WIP and this file will be updated soon.

# Building
Run `make` to build the executable (the unix `find` utility is required to be on your path. If you're on windows you can install it using scoop). <br>
`./carbon <filename>` to execute a source file.<br>
`make clean` to clean all generated binaries.<br>
Refer to the makefile for further instructions.
