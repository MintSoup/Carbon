# Carbon
Carbon programming language

# Introduction
Carbon is an interpreted, object oriented, VM-based, statically typed scripting language. It is intended to be simple, easy to use and easy to embed while maintaining flexibility. It is currently WIP and this file will be updated soon.

# Building
The unix `find` utility is required to be on your path. If you're on windows you can install it using scoop<br>
```
git clone https://github.com/MintSoup/Carbon.git
cd Carbon
make # or make -j$(nproc) for a faster build
```
Refer to the makefile for further instructions.
